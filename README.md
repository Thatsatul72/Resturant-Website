The Restaurant Booking Website is a user-friendly platform that enables customers to explore restaurant offerings and conveniently book tables online. Built with HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, and PHP, the website showcases sections for the menu, chefâ€™s specialties, testimonials, and a contact page. The front end, designed with HTML and CSS, provides 
an inviting, responsive design that adapts to any device. JavaScript is used for interactive elements such as an image carousel, menu navigation, and form validation.

The key feature of this website is the Booking Section, where users can reserve tables based on their preferred date, time, and seating preferences. A booking form captures 
details like name, phone number, number of guests, date, and time. On submission, the form data is sent to a PHP-based backend. Here, PHP handles form processing, validating the 
data, and securely storing booking details in a MySQL database. PHP then provides the user with booking confirmation, either displayed on the website or sent via email.

This project enhances the dining experience by simplifying the reservation process, offering restaurant owners an efficient way to manage bookings, reduce wait times, and 
ensure a seamless dining experience for customers.
